#### My Position
Enabling employees, that are remote (traveler and settler), hybrid, and in-office, is our new standard. They are internal employees and are customers as well. 
Travelers accelerate our best growth in this space by establishing **Core Tenets**:  
Security, productivity, reliability, modularity and redundancy.

#### Goal

Elevate the technical posture of all employees, by way of presenting the best practices of travelers. **These are subject to change, and are not legal advice.**  

##### HR

Employee personal residence (mail and street address) is in a locale that is approved by the employer (ex: State and Country). Employee CPA and Law firms can be established, to keep personal paperwork tidy - they are experts in supporting travelers. These firms are employee advocates and that relationship also benefits employers. They are encouraged but are not subject to disclosure to the employer.

##### Internet

Maintaining 2 cellphone data plans and may have access to other secured Wi-Fi, preferring 1) Best cell plan then 2) Second cell plan and then 3) Wi-Fi.

##### Gear

* **Smartphones** - 2 of them, allowing for any best SIM/internet-access plan to be used. Functionality is independent of the internet provider. Custom DNS is used, such as Cloudflare. The work phone number is VoIP and is app login-dependent, reducing SIM-swap/theft concerns. This will also allow for re-establishing work 2FA, as seamlessly and as quickly as possible. SMS, Email-to-SMS, and Voice calls are supported over any internet connection. This number reaches both phones, simultaneously.  
* **Laptops** - 2 of them. The second device can quickly be Windows 10/11 OS-reset for dedicated work use.  
* **External monitor** - Over weeks of testing, one is not necessary (though preferred), and so a backup, external monitor has not been required.  
* **Power** – A 20,000 mAh power bank, in addition to each device having at least 10 hours of life.  
* **Accessories** – These are numerous. They include personal comfort and health improvements, though have not been required.  
* **Physical Asset Security, Monitoring and Alerting** – Work laptop is powered down, if away for more than a short break, to utilize full disk encryption. When reasonable, the smartphone app Haven: Keep Watch is used.

##### Personal

Solutions for multiple recovery scenarios of physical and digital assets are implemented. 

#### Conclusion

This is a model for heightening the technical posture of employees.
