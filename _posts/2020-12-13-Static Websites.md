Remember when we had to create our own websites with Wordpress and either pay for hosting or maintain our own database?

I just created a few Static Websites (including this one), hosted on Github Pages. Thanks to Dean Attali for sharing all his hard work and making the [beautiful-jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com) repository available to all. Of any tech work, Web Dev I like the least. This was intuitive and it looks great.
